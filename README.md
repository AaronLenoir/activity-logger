# activity-logger

Quick and simple tool to help keep track of what I'm working on during a working-day.

## Download

## Version 1.1.1

https://github.com/AaronLenoir/activity-logger/releases/download/v1.1.1/ActivityLogger.1.1.1.msi

What's new:

- Startup and Shutdown time (of the activity logger)
- Idle time (> 5 minutes)
- Switched to 2 clause BSD license
- 1.1.1 removes a debug log that was accidentally left in 1.1.0

Enable them via the context menu (right click on the icon).
